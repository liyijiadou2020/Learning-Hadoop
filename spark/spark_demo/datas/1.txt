Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine
for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface
for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and
fault tolerance. Originally developed at the University of California,
Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to
the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since.
